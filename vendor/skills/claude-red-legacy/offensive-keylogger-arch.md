## SetWindowHookEx
Majority of malware uses user32.dll!SetWindowHookEx to create a global hook event. this modifies an internal structure in `win32k.sys`.
Internally, `SetWindowsHookEx` is just a user-mode wrapper around `NtUserSetWindowsHookEx` (which itself wraps around `zzzzNtUserSetWindowsHookEx`) in `win32k.sys`.  What happens after you call it depends on the **hook type** you request but the sequence is always the same four steps:

1. **Validate and allocate a hook record**  
   `win32k.sys` creates an internal `HOOK` structure, fills in the filter type, module handle, thread/desktop IDs, and inserts the structure at the **head of the global hook chain** for that type
2. **Decide whether the hook procedure must live in the target process**  
   - **Low-level hooks (`WH_KEYBOARD_LL`, `WH_MOUSE_LL`)**  
     – **NO** injection.  
     – The system leaves the hook DLL in the **original caller’s address space** and simply delivers the event to that process via an internal `WM_*` message posted to its **hidden “ghost” window** .  
   - **All other global hooks (`WH_KEYBOARD`, `WH_CBT`, `WH_GETMESSAGE`, …)**  
     – **YES** injection required.  
     – For every process that satisfies the filter (same desktop, matching bitness),
	   - In/before Vista: `win32k` queues an **asynchronous load request** to `csrss.exe`, which in turn calls `LoadLibraryEx` inside the target process, mapping the hook DLL and fixing up its entry point.
	   - After Vista: The target process is added to a **pending-load list** inside `win32k`; the **first user-mode exit** from kernel to that process takes the APC and calls `LdrLoadDll` directly.
     – The first time the target thread is about to return to user mode, the kernel **APCs** the loader, so the DLL’s `DllMain` runs in the context of the victim process.

3. **Event routing at runtime**  
   When the monitored event occurs (key press, window activation, etc.), `win32k` walks the hook chain **inside the thread that owns the input queue**.  
   - If the hook procedure lives in that process, the kernel simply **calls the address** inside the injected DLL.  
   - If the procedure lives in another process (low-level case), the kernel **marshals the raw parameters** (`KBDLLHOOKSTRUCT` / `MSLLHOOKSTRUCT`) into an internal message and posts it to the **installing thread’s message queue**.  
     That thread must keep pumping messages; otherwise, the system **blocks all further input** for the desktop, which is why low-level hooks are so easy to detect by their side-effect on system responsiveness.

4. **Mandatory `CallNextHookEx`**  
   Each hook handler **must** call `CallNextHookEx` to pass control down the chain.  
   Internally, `CallNextHookEx` is just a call back into `win32k`, which continues the chain walk; if any handler fails to call it, the chain is broken and subsequent handlers never run. This might break input for the whole session.
#### TLDR
- **Low-level hooks** look stealthy because **no foreign code is mapped**, but they **pin the installing thread** and are trivially detected by their **message-queue footprint**.  
- **Regular global hooks** achieve **true code injection** without `WriteProcessMemory` or `CreateRemoteThread`, but they **leave a mapped DLL** behind in every hooked process. Easy VAD artefact for EDRs.
	- most EDRs avoid exhaustive VAD walks for every process on every event due to performance, but many will do targeted scans on on suspicious events (allocation > 64 kB, RWX, etc.).
- The **hook chain is global per desktop**: once installed, your procedure sees **every qualifying event** on that desktop, which is why a single call can key-log the whole user session.
### IOCs:
- Could be caught by a hook in user32
- Additional entry in the VAD (EDRs can check if the DLL is signed),
- Mapped or on-disk DLL
	- Is it signed?
		- Memory scanners could detect non-backed-by-disk executable memory.
	- Does it have anything to do here?
	- Could be bypassed by ovewriting a present, mapped DLL with our memory?
		- Would need to prevent user from interacting with keyboard while it happens.

## NtUserSetWindowsHookEx / zzzzNtUserSetWindowsHookEx
Same as above but you're directly calling the lower-level function. Same IOCs, really. You're only bypassing potential hooks in user32.dll.
The full logic of these functions could be reimplemented fully without a jump to external modules but it has too much IOCs and is too complex to implement to really be interesting.

**Session boundary**: raw-input registration is **per-session**, not per-desktop.  
A service in session-0 **cannot** register for keyboard raw-input and expect to see session-1 keystrokes – the HID packets are **routed to the session that owns the target HWND**.  
(You **can** open the **physical keyboard device object** directly and parse HID, but that is a **completely different attack surface** – needs admin, bypasses win32k.)

### IOCs:
- Additional entry in the VAD (EDRs can check if the DLL is signed),
	- ^ only theorical. No EDR implements this afaik
- Mapped or on-disk DLL
	- Is it signed?
		- Memory scanners could detect non-backed-by-disk executable memory.
	- Does it have anything to do here?

### NtUserRegisterRawInputDevices / RegisterRawInputDevices

tells the window manager to **deliver raw HID packets** to **one specific HWND** (or to the thread whose queue the window is attached to)

Practical abuse scenario
1. Start a **background thread** in our process or implement a `PeekMessage` / `GetMessage` loop.
2. Create a **zero-sized message-only window** (`HWND_MESSAGE`).
3. Register keyboard raw-input with `RIDEV_INPUTSINK` – > this routes **all keyboard traffic** to our window **even when it is not in the foreground** .
4. Pump the thread’s message queue forever; in the `WM_INPUT` handler call `GetRawInputData` and log the `RAWKEYBOARD` payload.
5. exfil
6. Profit?

Because no hook is installed, this technique:
- does **not** appear in `WinDbg`’s `!hook` list
- leaves **no cross-process DLL mapping**
- is **invisible to most EDR “hook chain” sensors**

this **still requires your process to stay alive and message-aware**, and it **cannot key-log from sessions it is not running in**.

Kernel-mode implementation:
1. Sets an oplock to prevent race conditions
2. Validates parameters
3. `Win32AllocPoolWithQuotaZInit`  
    Allocates a **kernel copy** of the array
4. `RegisterRawInputDevices(v9, a2, 0)`
    Calls the **INTERNAL worker** (see below).  
    It walks the array, updates the **per-thread raw-input hook list**,  
    tells **hidclass** which top-level windows want raw HID traffic, etc.
5. `EtwTraceAuditApiRegisterRawInputDevices`  
    Emits an **ETW** event for **Audit/Threat-Intelligence** so that defenders can see which process just asked for raw keyboard data (keylogger-style activity).
6. Cleanup

The internal worker modifies our process's EPROCESS structure. This makes it so that we can't re-implement this from user-mode.

### IOCs:
- Raises ETW event from kernel-mode win32kfull.sys driver.
	- **NOT AVOIDABLE!**
	- Do AVs/EDRs really monitor it though?
		- Rumors have it that Defender does since 20H1.
	- The ETW payload contains **PID, TID, UsagePage, Usage, Flags** – enough to **trivially score** “key-board raw-input from a non-interactive process” as **suspicious**.
	- Channel is **on by default** and **cannot be disabled** without patching the kernel.  
		→ **This is the strongest IOC** for this technique; **do not discount it**.
- **Raw-input must have a window station and desktop** – the call **fails** (`ERROR_INVALID_WINDOW_HANDLE`) if the thread is **not connected to a desktop**.   Services running in session-0 with **no desktop** therefore **cannot** use this path; they **must** either:  
		– create a **hidden desktop** (logged by **Object Manager auditing**), or
		– open the **\Device\KeyboardClass0** device directly (creates **IRP_MJ_READ** telemetry).
		- Maybe less noisy?
	Both are **easy to alert on**.

## Capturing current window's name

To filter for interesting keystrokes you may only monitor keystrokes from Chrome.exe \ firefox.exe, etc.

Different methods of doing that:
### GetWindowTextA
- The most detected function ever, every skid keylogger calls it.
- Eventually wraps around `NtUserInternalGetWindowText`.
- Not much else to say.

### NtUserInternalGetWindowText
- Much less detected because its a very low-level function
- Same signature as **GetWindowTextW**
- Defined in `Win32kFull.sys`.
	- DLL: `win32u.dll`

Reverse-engineering this was very tedious because the only references of this online seem to be:
```C
BOOL InternalGetWindowText(HWND hwnd, LPWSTR pString, int cchMaxCount) {
	DWORD retval = (DWORD)NtUserInternalGetWindowText(hwnd, pString, cchMaxCount);
	if (!retval) {
        *pString = (WCHAR)0;
    }
	return retval
}
```

# Novel research

Now... that's all stuff that can be figured out by anyone determined
for the unique research... contact me @ lovestrangekz on tg, everything has a price :]


---
Ideas that were abandonned:
- Use `NtUserBuildHwndList`/`EnumWindows` and re-implement the z-order heuristic to generate the list of all handles to all windows and call IsWindowVisible on them and do some other stuff to figure out if they're foreground or not?
	- Abandonned because, while this works, this is so complex to implement and there's no reliable way of knowing if it's foreground from user-mode (check next point)

- Walk `_K_USER_SHARED_DATA` to query its `ConsoleSessionForegroundProcessId` member then query the system to know that PID's windows and hope it only has one
	- Abandonned because, as above, we can't really know if that window is in foreground,
	- doesn't help much if target PID has multiple window handles
